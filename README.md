# Titanic_EDA
For this project we have used the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle, a very famous data set in machine learning! We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased. Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification, followed by SVM (support vector machine) and then optimizing it via cross validation. We'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.
